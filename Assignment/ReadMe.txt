Note for video taking:


yi xu this is information you need to explain 
Remember this is test case that need to be demonstrated

in AmkHub

cinema	: Room3(premium)
Date	: HolidayDate
genre	: 3D 

so later user can see the difference

when demo try to books 2 times 
first when there is normal price movie and the other when the price is not normal 


to explain the last 2 parts of the requirement:
-go to staff again and try to update the status of particular date become end of showing 
-go to booking system again and you won't see that dateMovie
-and said that it just showing the schedule when it is now showing and preview


HAHAHAHAH 
Good luck 
hopefully the video is nice
